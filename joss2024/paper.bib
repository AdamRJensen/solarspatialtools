HOPE has been designed to provide an observational dataset for a critical evaluation of the new German community atmospheric icosahedral non-hydrostatic (ICON) model at the scale of the model simulations and further to provide information on land-surface–atmospheric boundary layer exchange, cloud and precipitation processes, as well as sub-grid variability and microphysical properties that are subject to parameterizations. HOPE focuses on the onset of clouds and precipitation in the convective atmospheric boundary layer.

	abstract = {The Wavelet Variability Model (WVM) for simulating solar photovoltaic (PV) powerplant output given a single irradiance sensor as input has been developed and validated previously. Central to the WVM method is a correlation scaling coefficient (A) that calibrates the decay of correlation of wavelet modes as a function of distance and timescale, and which varies by day and geographic location. Previously, a local irradiance sensor network was required to derive A. In this work, we determine A from cloud speeds. Cloud simulator results indicated that the A value is linearly proportional to the cloud speed (CS): A=12CS. Cloud speeds from a numerical weather model (NWM) were then used to create a database of daily A values for North America. For validation, the WVM was run to simulate a 48MW PV plant with both NWM A values and with ground A values found from a sensor network. Both WVM methods closely matched the distribution of ramp rates (RRs) of measured power, and were a strong improvement over linearly scaling up a point sensor. The incremental error in using NWM A values over ground A values was small. The ability to use NWM-derived A values means that the WVM can be used to simulate a PV plant anywhere a single high-frequency irradiance sensor exists. This can greatly assist in module siting, plant sizing, and storage decisions for prospective PV plants.},

The approach demonstrates that the relative power Output Variability for a fleet of identical PV systems (same size, orientation, and spacing) can be quantified by identifying the number of PV systems and their Dispersion Factor. The Dispersion Factor is a new variable that captures the relationship between PV Fleet configuration, Cloud Transit Speed, and the Time Interval over which variability is evaluated. Results indicate that Relative Output Variability: (1) equals the inverse of the square root of the number of systems for fully dispersed PV systems; and (2) could be further minimized for optimally-spaced PV systems.},

We provide case studies showing how to use this model to study inverter response to rapid irradiance fluctuations.

	abstract = {The main contributor to spatio-temporal variability in the solar resource is clouds passing over photovoltaic (PV) modules. Cloud velocity is a principal input to many short-term forecast and variability models. In this paper spatio-temporal correlations of irradiance data are analyzed to estimate cloud motion. The analysis is performed using two spatially and temporally resolved simulated irradiance datasets generated from large eddy simulation. Cloud motion is estimated using two different methods; the cross-correlation method (CCM) applied to two or a few consecutive time steps and cross-spectral analysis (CSA) where the cloud speed and direction are estimated by cross-spectral analysis of a longer time series. CSA is modified to estimate the cloud motion direction as the case with least variation for all the velocities in the cloud motion direction. To ensure reliable cloud motion estimation, quality control (QC) is added to the CSA and CCM analyses. The results show 33\% (52°) and 21\% (6°) improvement in the cloud motion speed (direction) estimation using the modified CSA and CCM over the original methods (without QC), respectively. In general, CCM results are accurate for all the different cloud cover fractions with average relative mean bias error (rMBE) of cloud speed and mean absolute error of cloud direction equal to 3\% and 3°, respectively. For low cloud cover fractions, CSA estimates the cloud motion speed and direction with rMBE and mean absolute error equal to 10\% and 11°, respectively. However, for high cloud cover fractions and unsteady cloud speed, CSA results are not reliable for 3–4 h time series; however, splitting the whole time series into shorter time intervals reduces the rMBE and mean absolute error to 15\% and 16° respectively.},

	abstract = {The irradiance at ground level mostly fluctuates due to cloud coverage. As clouds are moving toward a certain direction, the cardinal orientation of photovoltaic arrays affects the variability of the output power, and thus the impact on the electric power grid. This paper presents a new methodology with a circular layout for irradiance monitoring units to assess the solar variability in different directions of any site based on cloud speed-direction trend and directional variability reduction. The proposed methodology is used to assess the directional variability for a site at Varennes, QC, Canada using 1 year of measured data. The cloud speed direction is studied in order to observe any trend from a month-to-month and from an hour-to-hour. Overall the cloud direction has a trend of West to East direction, especially during the winter months. The variability reduction for each axis is estimated using the variability index (VI). The largest VI reduction is observed close to the cloud direction axis.},
